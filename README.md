#Weather app

I made this app to practice JQuery, geolocation with JavaScript, UX design, and retrieval from an API using [weatherbit.io](https://weatherbit.io).

I used Firebase to deploy the app. You can view it at https://kathleen-weather-app.web.app.

What I would like to do next:
* Put a textbox where you can specify your city instead of having to always grab the geolocation
* Place an image of the nearest city to you using [teleport.org](https://www.teleport.org)
* Make it mobile friendly
